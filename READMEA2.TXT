Reasons to use PFA rather than major brand programs:

1) Simpler and efficient to use
	 -not bloated with too many options
	 -simpler and faster navigation
	 -less user input required to perform most operations

2) Tithing is easily calculated and tracked, plus PFA can calculate 
		tithing on gross, or net income

3) Heavily tested to eliminate virtually all problems. If you find a 
	 problem, let me know and I will do my best to fix it


FEATURES NOT IMPLEMENTED IN PFA, BUT COULD BE IF THERE IS ENOUGH DEMAND:

Password protection of data files
Ability to void transactions

FEATURES IN THE PROCESS OF BEING ADDED:

Option to check file for data integrity (in case the file became 
	corrupted on the storage device, thus altering your data, checking the 
	integrity of the data would spot that the data has been corrupted)
Ability to psuedo-merge multiple files

FEATURES:

Efficient interface (takes some learning in order for efficiency)
Helps you keep track of your debt and loans and to who or what
Helps you keep track of where your expenses are, and how much (value & 
	percentage of total expenses excluding tithing)
Keeps track of how much tithing you owe, either off of net or gross income, 
	and how much you have paid
Helps you keep track of taxable income, earned interest, and tax deductibles
Lets you know how much you have spent, deposited, and income you have received
Keeps track of your current balance and the balance the bank has verified
Search for specific transactions (by pattern in the memos, category, 
	transactee or by a certain flag pattern (deposited, bank verified, taxable 
	income, etc.))

Added in version 2.1:
Check to see if tithing is owed on a file from the command line. (Thus 
	enabling the use of a script to automate the check and informing of the user)
