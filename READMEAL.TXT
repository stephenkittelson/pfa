Thank you for being willing to try out PFA! (Personal Financial Assistant)

I have worked to bring to you this financial assistant in hope that it will 
help you manage your finances more efficiently! You are welcome to try it out 
for a while to see if you like it. PFA is shareware. If you do end up using it 
normally, please compensate me for my efforts! It is only $10.

You can freely distribute this program to anyone you would like!

If you have a question that isn't answered in the tutorial or the 'help' 
section, please email me! If you don't have email, feel free to send a letter 
to the address listed in 'help'!
