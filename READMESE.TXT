	Run the program included with this file (Windows 95 or higher is required 
	for this, if you are just using DOS, download the zip file instead of this 
	self-extractor). A new window will pop up. Make sure the box under 'Unzip to 
	folder' contains the drive letter (including semi-colon, ex: 'C:' without 
	the ''s) of the drive that contains your 'Windows' directory. Click on 
	'Unzip', then click 'Ok' when it is finished extracting the 4 files, then 
	click 'Close'. A shortcut to PFA should appear on your desktop.
